## Pac-Man-adventures
### UC Berkeley's CS-188 Pacman projects

The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. 
They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. 
Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. 
These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.



#### Project 1 : Search
Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 
These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

#### Project 2: Multiagent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. 
Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

#### Project 3: Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. 
Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

#### Project 4: Classification
Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. 
Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
